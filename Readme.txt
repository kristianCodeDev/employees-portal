Note:

Due to policies from my company's clients I can't show any work related code. Thus I have created this example
project that demonstrates few of my skills - mobile friendly app, using modern pallet of colors and fonts,
using a creative way of implementing services on frontend side so that testing could be easily performed, code structure,
project structure (easily mantainable, refactorable, restructurable if the project becomes big).
The server is ment for only providing me with data and so that is why I used Express.js and not something more 
sophisticated. Also because it would be harder to launch the app that is why I didn't include a db and instead used json data
that comes from the server.
I have done similiar projects in my work in which I structured the project, mentored my teammates and led the project.
